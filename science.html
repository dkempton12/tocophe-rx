<h4>Innovative Medical solution<br> for Treatment of Infertility</h4>
</div>
<div id ="science">
	<h3>Scientific Background</h3>
		<p>An orally active FSH has been the futuristic goal of infertility
treatments since the inception of injectable therapies</p>
		<p>Professor Lunenfeld is best known for his pioneering work in 
human reproduction. Especially for extraction, purification and 
being the first to introduce human Menopausal Gonadotropins 
(hMG) for clinical use (1953-1961) in unovulatory women and 
hypopituitary-hypogonadotropic men.</p>
		<p>He was instrumental in the creation of an international standard 
for Gonadotropins, the classification of infertile patients and of 
the hyperstimulation syndrome. He has made significant 
contributions to the understanding of follicular recruitment, 
rescue, selection, growth and development, the ovulatory cycle 
and the mechanism of action of gonadotropins in ovaries and 
testis.</p>
		<p>“In the 1960s we were pioneers, treating infertility in women with purified hormones 
isolated from the urine of postmenopausal nuns.  Over the next few years we obtained 
highly purified hFSH through  immuno –purification.  A few decades later, a new set of 
scientists transformed this treatment with use of recombinant preparations that provided a 
more consistent dosing regimen.  Over the last 50 years, those of us who founded this field 
always dreamed that someday an oral FSH preparation could be available.  TocopheRx 
seems positioned to achieve this dream.”</p>

	<h3>Biology</h3>
		<p>- FSH, released from the pituitary of women 
regulates growth and maturation of oocytes
through its action on granulosa cells in the ovary</p>
		<p>- FSH released from the pituitary of men regulates 
cell division and growth of sperm through its 
action on Sertoli cells</p>
		<p>- LH (luteinizing hormone) causes final maturation 
and release of oocytes (ovulation) and sperm 
(spermiation)</p>
		<p>- LH also stimulates steroid production (estradiol 
for women; testosterone for men) that amplifies 
FSH and LH actions.</p>

	<h3>Structural Biology</h3>
	<p>FSH (blue; 33kD) and the inactive FSH
receptor (magenta & gray; 75 kD), are 
both large proteins. TocopheRx has 
successfully developed innovative small 
molecules that are 0.5 – 0.7 kD, and 
directly activate the transmembrane 
domain (green).  TocopheRx allosteric 
agonists (TOPs) enhance the response 
of the FSH receptor when a small 
amount of FSH is present.  TOP001 is 
unique because it also activates the LH 
receptor and enhances the ovarian
response.  TOP002 is predominantly an 
FSH receptor allosteric agonist.</p>
