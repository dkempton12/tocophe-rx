	<h3 class="about-us">About Us</h3>
<p>TocopheRx is focused on developing innovative medicines that reduce the stress of infertility treatments
for couples desiring to achieve the family plans.  Our disruptive technology is a small molecule that 
combines the activity of  both hormones used to treat infertility into a single molecule that will be 
delivered in a tablet to treat the infertile partner in a couple, whether it is the woman or the man.</p>
<p>The most significant trend affecting the fertility of both women and men is postponement of child-bearing until careers have been established.  Whether your decision relies on banking oocytes for the right partner, freezing embryos for future implantation, or treatment now to address current fertility problems, an orally active treatment regimen can be less stressful for both partners.</p>
<p>From the inception of TocopheRx, we have been committed to develop fertility treatments that are
extremely safe and highly effective.  Our development program has a strong emphasis on both efficacy 
and safety for patients receiving the treatment. Our goal is to help you reach your family objectives with 
less stress due to drug administration and earlier access to superior treatment options than can be 
achieved currently.</p>
